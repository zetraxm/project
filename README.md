This project is a Java-based implementation of the classic Tower of Hanoi puzzle game. The objective is to move all disks from Tower 1 to Tower 3, following the rules:

Only one disk can be moved at a time.

A larger disk cannot be placed on top of a smaller one.

ðŸ§  The game challenges logical thinking and recursive problem-solving skills.

âœ… Built using Java and object-oriented programming principles.
âœ… User input is supported to manually play the game.
âœ… Includes console-based visualization for easy interaction.
