This is a Java-based implementation of the classic Tower of Hanoi puzzle game, built using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture for clean and maintainable code separation.

üß© Game Objective:
Move all disks from Tower 1 to Tower 3, following these rules:

Only one disk can be moved at a time.

A larger disk cannot be placed on top of a smaller disk.

üß± Project Structure:
Model: Manages the game logic and state (disks, towers, and rules).

View: Displays information to the user via the console.

Controller: Handles user input and coordinates between Model and View.

‚úÖ Features:
Console-based user interface

Manual gameplay via user input

Uses recursion for the optimal solution

Clean code with object-oriented principles

üõ†Ô∏è Technologies:
Java (OOP, recursion, console I/O)

MVC architecture

This project showcases my skills in Java programming, clean architecture, recursion, and problem-solving.
